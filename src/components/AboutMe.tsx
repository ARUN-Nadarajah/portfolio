      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">
        I’m an IT student at SLIIT, specializing in Software Engineering. Currently, I’m diving deep into full-stack development with the MERN stack and exploring cybersecurity with Kali Linux.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of academics and tech, I serve as the Treasurer for the SLIIT Northern Uni Student Community, managing budgets and organizing events. In my free time, I enjoy motorcycle touring and drawing.
        <br /><br />
        I aspire to leverage my skills to create impactful tech solutions and grow as an entrepreneur.
